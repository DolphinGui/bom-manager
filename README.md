# Electrical Inventory Manager

**This project is abandoned. Use [Inventree](https://inventree.org/) instead.**

This was an attempt to build an electrical BOM/inventory manager, until I learned that
something better already existed. Incidentally, if you need an example of a program that
reads and writes google sheets, and has a neat TUI, this is it. Currently it allows for
the reading and modification of google sheets files from the terminal.
